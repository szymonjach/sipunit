/**
 * This class is used for handling one leg of a call. That is, it represents an outgoing call leg or
 * an incoming call leg. In a telephone call, there are two call legs. The outgoing call leg is the
 * connection from the phone making the call to the telephone network. The incoming call leg is a
 * connection from the telephone network to the phone being called. For a SIP call, the outbound leg
 * is the User Agent originating the call and the inbound leg is the User Agent receiving the call.
 * For each call leg, a separate SipCall object must be used.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A SipCall object is created by calling SipPhone.createSipCall() or SipPhone.makeCall().
 * 
 * <p>
 * Many of the methods in this class return an object or true return value if successful. In case of
 * an error or caller-specified timeout, a null object or a false is returned. The
 * getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode() and getException() methods may be used for further
 * diagnostics. The getReturnCode() method returns either the SIP response code received from the
 * network (defined in SipResponse) or a SipUnit internal status/return code (defined in
 * SipSession). SipUnit internal codes are in a specially designated range
 * (SipSession.SIPUNIT_INTERNAL_RETURNCODE_MIN and upward). The information provided by the
 * getException() method is only meaningful when the getReturnCode() method returns internal SipUnit
 * return code EXCEPTION_ENCOUNTERED. The getErrorMessage() method returns a descriptive string
 * indicating the cause of the problem. If an exception was involved, this string will contain the
 * name of the Exception class and the exception message. This class has a method, format(), which
 * can be called to obtain a human-readable string containing all of this error information.

   * The waitForCancelResponse() method waits for a response to be received from the network for a
   * sent CANCEL. Call this method after calling sendCancel().
   * <p>
   * This method blocks until one of the following occurs: 1) A response message has been received.
   * In this case, a value of true is returned. Call the getLastReceivedResponse() method to get the
   * response details. 2) A timeout occurs. A false value is returned in this case. 3) An error
   * occurs. False is returned in this case.
   * <p>
   * Regardless of the outcome, getReturnCode() can be called after this method returns to get the
   * status code: IE, the SIP response code received from the network (defined in SipResponse, along
   * with the corresponding textual equivalent) or a SipUnit internal status/error code (defined in
   * SipSession, along with the corresponding textual equivalent). SipUnit internal codes are in a
   * specially designated range (SipSession.SIPUNIT_INTERNAL_RETURNCODE_MIN and upward).
   * <p>
   * 
   * @param siptrans This is the object that was returned by method sendCancel(). It identifies a
   *        specific Cancel transaction.
   * @param timeout The maximum amount of time to wait, in milliseconds. Use a value of 0 to wait
   *        indefinitely.
   * @return true if a response was received - in that case, call getReturnCode() to get the status
   *         code that was contained in the received response, and/or call getLastReceivedResponse()
   *         to see the response details. Returns false if timeout or error.
