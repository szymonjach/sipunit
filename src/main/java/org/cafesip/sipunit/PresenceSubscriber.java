/**
 * The PresenceSubscriber class represents a buddy from a SipPhone buddy list or a single-shot
 * presence fetch performed by a SipPhone. This object is used by a test program to proceed through
 * the SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY sequence(s) and to find out details at any given time about the subscription
 * such as the subscription state, amount of time left on the subscription if still active,
 * termination reason if terminated, errors encountered during received SUBSCRIBE response and
 * incoming NOTIFY message validation, details of any received responses and requests if needed by
 * the test program, and the current or last known presence status/information (tuples/devices,
 * notes, etc.) for this subscription.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Please read the SipUnit User Guide, Event Subscription section for the NOTIFY-receiving side (at
 * least the operation overview part) for information on how to use the methods of this class and
 * its superclass.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As in the case of other objects like SipPhone, SipCall, etc., operation-invoking methods of this
 * class return an object or true if successful. In case of an error or caller-specified timeout, a
 * null object or a false is returned. The getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode() and getException()
 * methods may be used for further diagnostics. See SipPhone or SipActionObject javadoc for more
 * details on using these methods.
