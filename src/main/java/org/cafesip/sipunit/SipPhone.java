/**
 * This class provides a test program with User Agent (UA) access to the SIP protocol in the form of
 * a SIP phone. Using this class, a test program can simulate a SIP phone and perform operations
 * such as registration, making an outgoing call or receiving an incoming call, buddy list/fetch
 * (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY) operations, call refer, etc. In future, a SipPhone object can have more than
 * one SipCall object associated with it but currently only one is supported. Multiple subscriptions
 * (buddy/presence, refer) are supported per SipPhone object.
 *
 * <p>
 * A SipPhone object is created by calling SipStack.createSipPhone().
 *
 * <p>
 * Many of the methods in this class return an object or true return value if successful. In case of
 * an error or caller-specified timeout, a null object or a false is returned. The
 * getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode() and getException() methods may be used for further
 * diagnostics. The getReturnCode() method returns either the SIP response code received from the
 * network (defined in SipResponse) or a SipUnit internal status/return code (defined in
 * SipSession). SipUnit internal codes are in a specially designated range
 * (SipSession.SIPUNIT_INTERNAL_RETURNCODE_MIN and upward). The information provided by the
 * getException() method is only meaningful when the getReturnCode() method returns internal SipUnit
 * return code EXCEPTION_ENCOUNTERED. The getErrorMessage() method returns a descriptive string
 * indicating the cause of the problem. If an exception was involved, this string will contain the
 * name of the Exception class and the exception message. This class has a method, format(), which
 * can be called to obtain a human-readable string containing all of this error information.

  /**
   * This method is used for SIP registration. By default, the Request-URI is derived from this
   * SipPhone's proxy host, or if no proxy was specified when this SipPhone was created, the
   * Request-URI address information is taken from this SipPhone's URI (address of record). For
   * other Request-URI alternatives, see the register() method that takes parameter requestUri.
   *
   * <p>
   * Initially, a REGISTER message is sent without any user name and password. If the server returns
   * an OK, this method returns a true value.
   *
   * <p>
   * If any challenge is received in response to sending the REGISTER message (response code
   * UNAUTHORIZED or PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED), the SipPhone's credentials list is checked
   * first for the corresponding realm entry. If found, the credentials list entry username and
   * password are used to form the required authorization header for resending the REGISTER message
   * to the server, and the authorization header is saved for later re-use. You can clear out saved
   * authorization headers by calling the unregister() method.
   *
   * <p>
   * If the challenging realm is not found in the SipPhone credentials list, the user parameter
   * passed to this method is examined. If it is null, this method returns false. If it is not null,
   * the user and password values passed in to this method are used to respond to the challenge. The
   * credentials list is not modified by this scenario (no entry is automatically added with this
   * user, password). Also, the authorization created for this registration is not saved for re-use
   * on a later registration. IE, the user/password parameters are for a one-time, single-shot use
   * only.
   *
   * <p>
   * After responding to the challenge(s) by resending the REGISTER message, this method returns a
   * true or false value depending on the outcome as indicated by the server.
   *
   * <p>
   * If the contact parameter is null, user@hostname is used where hostname is the SipStack's IP
   * address property which defaults to InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress(), and other
   * SipStack properties also apply. Otherwise, the contact parameter given is used in the
   * Registration message sent to the server.
   *
   * <p>
   * If the expiry parameter is 0, the registration request never expires. Otherwise, the duration,
   * given in seconds, is sent to server.
   *
   * <p>
   * This method can be called repeatedly to update the expiry or to add new contacts.
   *
   * <p>
   * This method determines the contact information for this user agent, whether the registration
   * was successful or not. If successful, the contact information may have been updated by the
   * server (such as the expiry time, if not specified to this method by the caller). Once this
   * method has been called, the test program can get information about the contact for this agent
   * by calling the *MyContact*() getter methods.
   *
   * @param user Optional - user name for authenticating with the server. Required if the server
   *        issues an authentication challenge.
   * @param password Optional - used only if the server issues an authentication challenge.
   * @param contact An URI string (ex: sip:bob@192.0.2.4), or null to use the default contact for
   *        this user agent.
   * @param expiry Expiry time in seconds, or 0 if no registration expiry.
   * @param timeout The maximum amount of time to wait for a response, in milliseconds. Use a value
   *        of 0 to wait indefinitely.
   * @return false if registration fails or an error is encountered, true otherwise. In case of
   *         false, call getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode() and/or getException() methods to find
   *         out why.

   * presence capabilities.
   *

   * This method creates a SUBSCRIBE request message, sends it out, and waits for a response to be
   * received. It saves the received response and checks for a "proceedable" (positive) status code
   * value. Positive response status codes include any of the following: provisional (status / 100

   * a response timeout or any other error, is considered fatal to the subscription.
   *
   * <p>
   * This method blocks until one of the above outcomes is reached.
   *

   * In the case of a positive response status code, this method returns a PresenceSubscriber object

   * object in this SipPhone's buddy list. You can save the returned PresenceSubscriber object
   * yourself or retrieve it anytime later by calling this SipPhone's getBuddyInfo(buddy-uri). Use
   * the returned PresenceSubscriber object to proceed through the remainder of this
   * SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY sequence as well as for future SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY sequences and to find out
   * details at any given time such as the subscription state, amount of time left on the
   * subscription, termination reason, presence information, details of received responses and
   * requests, etc.
   *
   * <p>
   * In the case of a positive response status code (a non-null object is returned), you may find
   * out more about the response that was just received by calling the PresenceSubscriber methods
   * getReturnCode() and getCurrentResponse()/getLastReceivedResponse(). Your next step at this
   * point will be to call the PresenceSubscriber's processResponse() method to proceed with the
   * SUBSCRIBE processing.
   *
   * <p>
   * In the case of a fatal outcome, no subscription object is created and null is returned. In this
   * case, call the usual SipUnit failed-operation methods to find out what happened (ie, call this
   * SipPhone's getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode(), and/or getException() methods). The
   * getReturnCode() method will tell you the response status code that was received from the
   * network (unless it is an internal SipUnit error code, see the SipSession javadoc for more on
   * that).
   *

   *        subscription won't be active.

   *        parameter. Whatever is indicated here will be used subsequently (for error checking
   *        SUBSCRIBE responses and NOTIFYs from the server as well as for sending subsequent
   *        SUBSCRIBEs) unless changed by the caller later on another buddy method call
   *        (refreshBuddy(), removeBuddy(), fetch, etc.).

  /**
   * This basic refer method creates an out-of-dialog REFER request message, sends it out, and waits
   * for a first response to be received. It saves the received response and checks for a
   * "proceedable" (positive) status code value. Positive response status codes include any of the
   * following: provisional (status / 100 == 1), UNAUTHORIZED, PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED, OK and
   * ACCEPTED. Any other status code, or a response timeout or any other error, is considered fatal
   * to the subscription.
   *
   * <p>
   * This method blocks until one of the above outcomes is reached.
   *
   * <p>
   * In the case of a positive response status code, this method returns a ReferSubscriber object
   * that represents the implicit subscription. You can save the returned object yourself or
   * retrieve it anytime later by calling one of this SipPhone's getReferrerInfo() methods or
   * getRefererList(). Use the returned subscription object to proceed through the remainder of this
   * REFER-NOTIFY sequence as well as for future SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY sequences on this subscription and
   * also to find out details at any given time such as the subscription state, amount of time left
   * on the subscription, termination reason, details of received responses and requests, etc.
   *
   * <p>
   * In the case of a positive response status code (a non-null object is returned), you may find
   * out more about the response that was just received by calling the ReferSubscriber methods
   * getReturnCode() and getCurrentResponse(). Your next step will then be to call the
   * ReferSubscriber's processResponse() method to proceed with the REFER processing.
   *
   * <p>
   * In the case of a fatal outcome, no subscription object is created and null is returned. In this
   * case, call the usual SipUnit failed-operation methods to find out what happened (ie, call this
   * SipPhone's getErrorMessage(), getReturnCode(), and/or getException() methods). The
   * getReturnCode() method will tell you the response status code that was received from the
   * network (unless it is an internal SipUnit error code, see the SipSession javadoc for more on
   * that).
   *
   * @param refereeUri The URI (ie, sip:bob@nist.gov) of the far end of the subscription. This is
   *        the party the REFER request is sent to.
   * @param referToUri The URI that the refereeUri is to refer to. You can use SipPhone.getUri() to
   *        create this object for you to pass in, or you can create your own using the JAIN SIP
   *        API.
   * @param eventId The event "id" to use in the REFER message, or null for no event "id" parameter.
   *        If an eventId is specified here, it will be used subsequently for error checking the
   *        REFER responses and the NOTIFYs from the far end as well as for sending subsequent
   *        SUBSCRIBEs unless changed by the caller later when invoking ReferSubscriber methods
   *        refresh() or unsubscribe().
   * @param timeout The maximum amount of time to wait for a response, in milliseconds. Use a value
   *        of 0 to wait indefinitely.
   * @param viaNonProxyRoute Affects the routing of the REFER message. By default, the message is
   *        routed to the Proxy that was specified when this SipPhone object was created
   *        (SipStack.createSipPhone()) or if no proxy was specified then, the REFER is looped back
   *        to this local sip stack. If the viaNonProxyRoute parameter is not null, it overrides the
   *        default behavior and causes the message to be routed differently, to the
   *        viaNonProxyRoute node which is specified as "hostaddress:port/transport" i.e.
   *        129.1.22.333:5060/UDP. A route header will be added to the REFER for this, before the
   *        request is sent.
   *
   * @return ReferSubscriber object representing the implicit subscription if the operation is
   *         successful so far, null otherwise.
